Development Plan
===

Iteration 1 - Home page
---
- nav bar
	- Should be across the top of the page
	- should be responsive
	- should include links (eventually) for the resume, the blog, the project section, the about section, and the study section.  Note that study is not project, so they do not have to be synced.
	- when in a small screen, the menu is concise, and scrolls off screen.  Clicking causes the menu to expand, covering the screen.
	- at least when full screen it should have a good logo and/or a good font for the title
	- a good title would be nice
	- use fonts from the resume section maybe.  
- content
	- should have a slide show featuring the big news items of the page, and maybe links to blog entries.  Potentially a second slide show to either the projects or the study section. 
	- Do not go too overboard.  Too much content is bad.  
	- Once Iteration 1 is published, it does not need content other than a "coming soon" headline and photo.  Maybe a reference to the Cubs winning the World Series.

Iteration 2 - Blog
---
	- Should have a few different templates for a blog post, and several entries.  
	- Entries should introduce me and my interests, and provide some background for motivation and experience.
		- possible examples are a short bio, an explanation of why the school system sucks, a rundown of some music thoughts, and an intro to math, programming, or electronics.
		- possibly a book list
		- possbly a list of future projects
		- possibly an explanation of learning tools and habits/approaches (anki, reading out loud, textbooks over pdf, etc)
	- should implement tagging the entries for later searching/sorting and database development

Iteration 3 - Projects
---
	- this should be a specialized blog section adapted specifically from projects.  
	- should start with Code Brix, and go from the beginning, evaluating the previous designs, introducing new features, and going to the end
	- should use two implementations for the command stacks ( shift registers, bit-bang, or a CAN based implementation)
	- Covers all project domains I am interested in, so it can have its own menu page
	- can include the website development project as well 
	- sections can include
		- hardware
		- software
		- wood/carpentry/physical projects
		- music / art

Iteration 4 - Studies
---
	- Studies is a specialized and adapted form of the blog.  
	- Covers all subjects I am interested in, so it can have its own menu page
	- can link back and forth between relevant blog posts and projects
	- subjects to include
		- math / programming (they go hand in hand) / software
		- language
		- engineering / science / hardware
		- civics
		- personal investment (is civics, but is so important for personal life as well so it gets its own)
		- health / fitness 
		- games / sports (chess and baseball, poker, risk?)
		- computers generally
		- music / art
		- myself

Iteration 5 - work on studies, projects, and news, publishing as often as possible
---

Iteration 6 - Annihilating the current education system with a free (or at least almost free) self education program
---
	- develop a curriculum architecture
	- develop a site architecture
	- develop a plan of attack

Iteration 7 - Build the site
---

Iteration 8 - Build the curriculum
---

Iteration 9 - Save the country, the world, and the future, while profiting handsomly
---
