Website DEV
---

This is for experimenting and developing my website, beginning with HTML5 and CSS3, and progressing through javascript, php5, Apache and Linux, building the whole LAMP stack.  Unless I decide to go with a c++ framework for my development at some point, which may happen.  

The website will start off as just a home page for me to throw updates on and some blog posts.  It will then build a resume section and a project section, to document my various projects, which extend across a broad spectrum of interests, from music, to some carpentry, luthier stuff, electronics, and studying.  I aim to learn as much as I can, and help anyone interested to do the same.  It will probably get a little brainy, but there's nothing wrong with that.  I have some approaches that I don't see too often, so it might be fun.  

Have a good day,

Nick
